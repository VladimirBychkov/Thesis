The goal of this work is to study and understand properties of one of the most 
mysterious elementry particles in the universe - neutrinos. Neutrino is chargeless and 
has mass which is less by many orders of magnitude than masses of others fundamental 
particles. It is known that neutrinos could interact only through weak and 
gravitational forces which leads to a several light years of mean free path in 
the matter. Despite their tiny mass and weak interaction with the matter, they are 
very interesting not only to elementary particle physics community but also to 
cosmologists and astrophysicists. Neutrinos carry away almost all energy of supernova 
explosion and can tell a lot about a dying star's internal structure and the last 
seconds of its life. Neutrino telescopes may open a new window for Universe observation 
and give a unique look into phenomena which could not be seen by conventional 
telescopes. These light, electrically neutral particles also can show physicists 
a possible direction towards new physics. The list of examples why neutrinos are 
important continues to grow, and it gives a sense that neutrino physics is a 
very rich and interesting subject to study.\\

In addition, neutrinos take part in one more fascinating phenomenon called neutrino
oscillations. While produced in one flavour after travel some distance neutrino is 
changing its flavour to another one in an oscillatory way. The NOvA - 
NuMI\footnote{Neutrino at the Main Injector} Off-axis Neutrino Appearnace - experiment
was designed to study properties of these oscillations. There are several
parameters which fully describe neutrino oscillations and analysis presented in this work 
is focused on measuring $\sin^2\theta_{23}$ and $|\Delta m^2_{32}|$. The measurements 
come from studying a specific mode of the oscillations: $\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_\mu$.
