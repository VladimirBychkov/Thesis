The data analysed in the present work were taken between 2014 and 2017 in a neutrino mode. The results 
presented in the previous chapter prefer non-maximal mixing at the significance level of 0.6 $\sigma$
with best-fit oscillation parameters
\be
\sin^2\theta_{23} = 0.567, \nn
\ee
\be
\Delta m^2_{32} = 2.45 \times10^{-3}~ eV^2. \nn
\ee

The selection criteria to select developed in the present thesis
