To measure $\theta_{23}$ and $\Delta m_{32}^2$, neutrino-nucleon interaction events must be identified, and the
resulting lepton and hadron energies and trajectories must be measured. To do this, data from the
detectors is reconstructed into particles, and $\nu_\mu$ CC interactions are identified. The
reconstruction process chain is summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Slicing. The full 550$\mu s$ readout window contains hits which are associated with
neutrino interaction, cosmis rays activity and noise. The hits need to be separated into
different groups which ideally correspond to different physical processes.
\item Tracking.  Each slice is processed by a tracking algorithm to detrmine 3-dimensional particle
trajectories.
\item Calibration. Each channel in every slice is calibrated to convert the magnitude of each
measured signal into a channel energy.
\item Muon identification and Background rejection. Slices that contain a muon track are identified
as pertinent to the $\nu_\mu$ CC interaction.
\item Energy estimation. Templates are used to map muon track length to true muon energy and visible 
hadronic energy\footnote{Total energy of all hits in the slice which do not belong muon track} to true 
hadronic energy in order to determine neutrino total energy.  
\end{itemize}
The analysis done here is based on two different data samples - contained and uncontained muons -
that were selected and processed by different reconstruction algorithms. Muon identification and energy
estimation algorithms used in the contained sample are explaned here, and algorithms used in the uncontained
sample are explained later.

\section{Slicing}
As can be seen on the figure \ref{fig:EVD_full} data recorded for one NuMI spill contains
multple uncorrelated activities. Even though the length of NuMI spill is 10$\mu s$ in the middle
of 550$\mu s$ readout window, the slicer algorithm is applied to all the hits in the window to protect 
against small possible drift of NuMI spills as well as to make slices for cosmic rays for background
estimation.

The task of the slicer is to group hits, which casually related to each other, in slices. The slicer 
is based on DBSCAN algorithm \cite{DBSCAN}, one of the most common clustering algorithms, and checks 
every pair of hits to determine how far are they from each other in space and time. The distance 
function is not exactly spice-time interval but rather modified 
\be
d = \Big(\frac{\Delta t - \frac{\Delta r}{c}}{T_{res}}\Big)^2 + \Big(\frac{\Delta z}{D_z}\Big) + 
\Big(\frac{\Delta v}{D_v}\Big),
\ee 
where $c$ is the speed of light, $\Delta t$ and $\Delta r$ are time and space difference between two 
hits respectively, $T_{res}$ is the timing resolution, $\Delta z$ is the distance between the hits
along the z direction, $\Delta v$ is the distance between hits in x or y direction. As soon as the 
function returns value which is lower than predefined treshold, two hits are put together in one slice.
The first term prefers hits which lie close to a light cone, in other words it is assumed that all
the particles move with the speed of light\footnote{Or energy of the particles is much large than their 
masses.} The second and the third terms penalize hits which are far from each other in space. These
terms help to remove noise hits as they are randomly distributed in space and time, and thefore, they 
could be far from the main activity. After all corellated activities have been accounting for, and 
slices are created, the remaining hits are put into one additional noise slice.

NOvA slicing algorithms does efficiently separates different neutrino activities in the near detector
and distinguishes cosmic rays from neutrino interactions in the far detector. However, hits which were produced
by Michele electrons\footnote{Electron produced in muon decay often called after Louis Michele who
contributed significantly to the physics of charged leptons decay.} or photons follow neutrons capture are
usually not included in the corresponding slice.

\label{fig:EVD_full}
\end{figure}

\section{Tracking}
As all the activities are separated into corresponding slices the next step in reconstruction chain is 
to find sets of hits which are attributed to the different particles produced in the neutrino interaction 
or cosmic activity. Cosmic ray activity is usually consistent with only one particle, while neutrino 
interaction measurements are usually consistent with multiple particles.

NOvA tracking algorithm is based on Kalman filtering \cite{Kalman} and its implementation could be found 
in \cite{Nick}. In short, algorithm is run on two views (X and Y) separately and merge 2D tracks into
3D ones. To construct a 2D track two hits with separation smaller than three planes are choosen as track 
seeds at most downstream location\footnote{Downstream in a sence of incoming neutrino from Fermilab}. 
Algorithm is working upstream and added hits are fit with piecewise linear segments. To add hit or not 
is decided on the basis of how much is the $\chi^2$ is changed for the hit; if less than eight units 
then hit is added. Fitting track with linear segments naturally helps to follow particles trajectory 
with multiple scatterings. A track is considered to be reconstructed if algorithm travels more than 3 planes
and no hits are added, and the algorithm is run repetitively until no more tracks are reconstructed. 
The majority of the particles produced by neutrino interactions travel dowstream, and thus the longest 
track, often the muon, is reconstructed first.

After all 2D tracks are found in both views they need to be merged into 3D tracks. Tracks are merged based on
a geometric algorithm that considers the degree of overlap of disparate tracks, and the distances between
their start and end points. For each track in X view with Z coordinates $(z_{x1}, z_{x2})$ and track in Y view with
Z coordinates $(z_{y1}, z_{y2})$
\be
\text{score} = \frac{|z_{x1}-z_{y1}| + |z_{x2}-z_{y2}|}{\min(z_{x2},z_{y2}) - \max(z_{x1},z_{y1})}.
\ee
The pair of 2D tracks with the lowest score are merged into one 3D track, and identified as one particle.
The merging process continues until there are no 2D tracks to merge, unmatched 2D tracks are also recorded
for possible analysis later.

\section{Calibration}
To convert cell hit arbitrary electronic units (ADC) into meaningful energy units (GeV) a calibration 
process should be carried out. Calibration consists of two parts - attenuation and absolute energy calibration. 
Both parts would be briefly explained in this section.

\subsection{Attenuation correction}
After ADC signal was produced it has to be decided by what factor signal should be multiplied since hit at
the far end of the cell will result in a smaller signal as compared to a signal from a hit in the middle. 
For the obvious reasons hits produced by beam neutrino are no appropriate for the calibration. However,
the abundance of cosmic rays with well understood properties helps with the procedure. Among all reconstructed 
cosmic tracks those are choosen which start and end on detector edges, this criterion is needed to make sure
that tracks are not stopped inside the detector. Additional requirement is that tracks should cross more than
ten planes, thus allowing an accurate estimation of muon path in every cell it crosses. Finally, only those 
hits on tracks are used for callibration which satisfy tri-cell criterion - a hit for callibration should
have both adjacent cells to be hit, see figure \ref{fig:tri-cell}. This conditions lead to a good estimation 
of muon trajectory and hence path length within each cell\footnote{Only for cells which satisfies tri-cell 
criterion.}.
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/tri-cell.png}
\caption{Tri-cell creterion.}
{The cell hit is used in calibration only if adjacent cells in the same view are also hit.}
\label{fig:tri-cell}
\end{figure}

The ADC signal is scaled to PE value - estimation for maximal value of electronic signal based on 4 recorded 
ADCs, see chapter \ref{simulation_chapter} for more details. After that for each reference hit, the path length 
and position within the cell ($W$) is estimated and 2D histogram - ratio of PE and path length versus position 
within the cell - is made. Mean ration of PE and path length as function of $W$ is fit by the sum of two exponents
which represent signal trip in two direction along the wave shifting fiber.
\be
y(W) = C + A\Big(e^{\frac{W}{X}} + e^{-\frac{L+W}{X}}\Big),
\ee
where $A$ and $C$ are fit parameters, $X$ is the fiber attenuation length and $L$ is length of the fiber. For
information about additional effects close to cell ends see \cite{calib_technote}. Figure \ref{fig:att_fit} shows 
examples of the fit for far and near detectors.
\begin{figure}[t!]
\begin{subfigure}[t]{0.9\textwidth}

\end{subfigure}
\caption{Attenuation fits}
{Examples of attenuation fits in Near (top) and Far (bottom) detectors.}
\label{fig:att_fit}
\end{figure}

For analysis part $W$ of every hit is estimated and PE value of the hit is divided by fit at this posotion to 
get a corrected PE value of the hit. Since attenuation curve determines cell responce to cosmic ray muons, thus 
corrected PE value of the hit shows the relative signal to the cosmic muons. At this point, attenuation is taken
into account but units of corrected PE signal is still arbitrary and absolute energy calibration is still needed. 

\subsection{Absolute energy calibration}
As in the previous step cosmic muons is used at this step too, but rather using middle part of cosmic muon tracks
here is used an end of the track. Thus, tracks which are used for calibration should stop inside the detector. 
The reason for using tracks end is that according to Bethe-Block formula \cite{rpf} muon energy deposition per 
unit length ($\frac{dE}{dx}$) has a well understood minimum near the track end. The minimum deposition is typically
span several meters from the end of the track for different materials and region from 1 meter to 2 meters from
the end of the track is used in NOvA absolute energy calibration procedure \ref{fig:dEdx_vs_length}.

{Already calibrated $\frac{dE}{dx}$ is shown as a function of distance to the end of the track.}
\label{fig:dEdx_vs_length}
\end{figure}

\section{Muon Identification}
Neutrino disappearance analysis is heavily relies on correct identification of muon among the byproducts of 
neutrino interaction with detector material. Existence of the muon in the event suggests $\nu_\mu$ CC interaction
and event is passed downstream for further analysis. Currently, NOvA uses two different algorithms to identify 
muons: the k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) clustering algorithm, and a convolutional neural network. Extensive analysis 
has shown that using both algorithms gives better results than either of them individually.

\subsection{ReMID}
The Reconstructed Muon Identification (ReMID) algorithm uses four characteristics of a each reconstructed track
to identify muons. kNN stores training examples in the 4-dimensional (number of dimensions
is equal to number of features extracted from the track) space with additional label specifying the class examples
belong to - muon or non-muon. These training examples were taken from NOvA simulation. Four features from the 
test track are represent a point in this 4-dimensional space and in order to determine the probability the point 
corresponds to a muon track kNN finds its $k$ nearest neighbors\footnote{Regular $L^2$ metric in $R^4$ is used;
$||\vec{r}_1 - \vec{r}_2||^2 = (x_1-x_2)^2 + (y_1-y_2)^2 + (z_1-z_2)^2 + (w_1-w_2)^2$} and calculates the 
fraction of muon nieghbors. This fraction is output of kNN algorithm. Number $k$ is adjustable hyperparameter 
and was choosen to be equal 80 in NOvA. 

Four features which exctracted from the track are track length, $\frac{dE}{dx}$ log-likelihood, scattering 
log-likelihood and non-hadronic plane fraction. $\frac{dE}{dx}$ and scattering log-likelihood are determined with 
the help of probability distributions that shows particle probability to deposit some energy and scatter by some 
angle at some distance from the end of the track, and these distributions are derived from simulation, for more 
information see chapter 6 of \cite{Nick}. The last feature is a ratio of number of planes in the track which are 
free of hadronic shower contamination and total number of planes in the track. 

\subsection{CVN}
Convolutional Visual Networks (CVNs) are neutral networks that excel in image classification, and are used in
NOvA to identify muons. The full implementation of the CVN is described in \cite{CVN}, and the key points are
described here.

In its core CVN is a regular neural network but with tens of hidden layers and tens of millions of weights. 
On the higher level though, CVN learns features itself and a human is no longer required to for this work.
An input to CVN is two pictures 100 by 80 pixels around neutrino activity in X and Y views. Similar to ReMID, labels 
for the training pictures are taken from the simulation. However, the biggest difference is that while ReMID checks
one track at a time and does the muon/non-muon classification for track, CVN analyzes the whole activity in the 
slice and does the classification in multiple classes - muon/electron/tay neutrino, QE/RES/DIS/MEC interaction, 
NC interaction and cosmic rays.

A deep convolutional neural network requires tremendous amount of training samples to prevent an overfitting togther 
with regularization techniques such as dropout layers and weight decay. In order to increase available 
training dataset some pictures are randomly changed. First, Gaussian noise is added to all pixels with a standard 
deviation of 1$\%$, this also reduces reliance on the simulated intensity in each pixel. Then, some pictures 
are reflected in the direction perpendicular to neutrino beam. An example of pictures that are fed into CVN are
shown in Figure \ref{fig:cvn_example}.
\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/cvn_example.pdf}
\centering
\caption{CVN Pixel Map.}
{Example of the figure which is fed into convolutional neural net for training. The window of $100\times80$ 
pixels is chosen around the true $\nu_\mu$ CC interaction activity in a such way that reconstructed vertex is 
approximately put in the left middle part of the picture.}
\label{fig:cvn_example}
\end{figure}

As stated above, CVN classifies events in multiple classes i.e. CVN output is n-dimensional vector of unit length
where components reperesent probability that the current event belongs to a particular class. Only muon neutrinos
are used in the current analysis, thus to select an event sum of outputs in muon/QE, muon/RES, muon/DIS and 
muon/MEC classes should be bigger than some treshold.

\section{Energy Estimation}
The final step in the reconstruction chain is estimating the total neutrino energy. The probability that one
flavor of neutrino with a given energy will oscillate to other flavors depends on its energy, thus more
precise measurements of energy would yield better measurements of $\theta_{23}$ and $\Delta m_{32}^2$.
Simple approach like sum of all the calibrated energy and additional accounting for dead 
material\footnote{Dead material consists of any detector parts which are not producing light i.e., plastic, air 
bubble, glue and possible gaps between planes.} is not as good as the following one. In NOvA, energy estimation 
process is divided into two similar parts; energy estimation of the most muon like track and the rest of the 
activity, since muon part of the event is well understood while the hadronic part is not so well.
\be
E_\nu = E_\mu + E_{had}.
\lb{Enu}
\ee 
The muon energy, $E_{\mu}$, is estimated using a 2D histogram that shows the true muon energy versus track length.
This histogram was populated using muons produced in simulated neutrino interactions that were reconstructed with
a ReMID output above zero, and a CVN output above 0.6 \cite{energy_technote}. The fit is a piecewise linear spline
with multiple segments; an example of this function is shown in Figure \ref{fig:mue_fit}.
\begin{figure}[t]

{Muon track energy is measured based on muon track length. The fit is a piecewise linear spline, vertical dashed
lines represent joint points and red line is a fit. Stiches, offsets and slopes are free parameters of the fit.}
\label{fig:mue_fit}
\end{figure}

The second term in \ref{Enu} is the hadronic energy, and is estimated differently. Calibrated energy of all hits 
which are not on muon track is summed together with additional hadronic energy which overlaps with muon track. 
The algorithm that determines how much energy overlaps with muon track is described in \cite{Kanika}. The hadronic
energy is challenging to model correctly, so instead of true hadronic energy the fit uses true neutrino energy minus
reconstructed muon energy. This approach accounts for dead material automatically. Similar to muon case, the fit 
is piecewise linear spline with up to four segments, as shown in figure \ref{fig:hade_fit}. The optimization is done
to minimize the total neutrino energy resolution rather then resolution of muon and hadronic energies separately. 

The detectors operating conditions change with time, so to improve the analysis different energy estimators were used
during different data taking periods.
