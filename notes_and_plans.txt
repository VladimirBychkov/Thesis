NOvA is doing nu_e dissapearance and nu_mu appearance measurements, a lot of cross section measurements at near detector!

Need to add Standard Model explanation to history or theory chapter. Maybe beter for its own short chapter.

Add more on neutrino dissapearance experiments, discovery of oscillations, shortage of solar neutrino etc.

How significant metter effects are for NOvA experiment (Susan's thesis)
